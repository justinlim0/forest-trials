# Forest-Trials

## Description
"Forest Trials" is a short, turn-based adventure game that I made in the 10th grade, using Python and a web browser based IDE called Replit. It uses basic classes, user-defined functions, and menus based on while loops. The graphics for the simple story all use ASCII art.
