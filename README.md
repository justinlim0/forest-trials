# Forest-Trials

## Description
"Forest Trials" is a short, turn-based adventure game that I made in the 10th grade, using Python and a browser-based IDE called Replit. It uses basic classes, user-defined functions, and menus based on while loops. The graphics for the simple story all utilize ASCII art. It takes heavy inspiration from traditional turn-based JRPGs, especially Final Fantasy.

### The Battle System
The battle system is mostly luck-based, and difficulty is determined by the health and attack stat of enemies. The user is given combat choices via the "Attack" menu, but the end results of every attack is random.
